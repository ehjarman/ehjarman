- Hi, I’m @ehjarman
- I’m interested in anything mechanics or applied biomechanics related! I like to think of interesting ways of
  using biometrics to analyze and optimize human performance. I also like to make associated projects in my freetime that improve my daily life.
- I’m currently learning arduino, C++, and new CAD softwares.
